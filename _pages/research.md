## Prediction of Mechanical Properties of Spider Silk using deep learning
### Jan 2022 - Present
Spider silk's mechanical properties are dependent on various repetitive regions of amino acids within the major and minor ampullate spidroin. As the part of this research,
* Developed an interpretable ML model to predict the mechanical properties of the spider silk just based on the primary sequence of spidroins. 
* Showed that including the information about the B-factor of residues in spidroins helps in improving the predictive capability
* Working to identifying the motifs in proteins that prominently contribute to various mechanical properties. 
* Manuscript is under preparation

## Prediction of B-factor in proteins using deep learning
### Aug 2022 - Dec 2022
B-factor of the atom in protein is the measure of its displacement about its mean position. It has been found that B-factor correlates well with many properties of protein such as flexibility, stability, and mechanical properties. Therefore, it is important to have a good predictive model for the B-factor. Hence, as part of this work, we did the following:
* Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict the B-factor of residues in proteins just based on the primary sequence. We were able to achieve a better fit than the state-of-the-art. Additionally, as the prediction is just based on the primary sequence, the developed model can be used for the B-factor prediction in *de novo* proteins.
* Used the trained model to study the impact of Euclidean distance between the atoms on their B-factor. We concluded that atoms within 15 angstrom of distance impact each other profoundly. 
* This work is under submission in Cell Patterns.
  

## Characterizing the fatigue behavior of Smart Piezoelectric Composite
### Jan 2015 - April 2017
Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) is a smart piezoelectric composite with high flexibility and piezoelectric coupling. To increase its usage in various applications, it is important to study its fatigue behavior. As part of this research, we did the following:
* Developed a Finite Element (FE) code to predict the actuation performance of MFC in a uni-morph and bi-morph configuration 
* Developed experimental setups to study the fatigue behavior of MFC under mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads
* Developed FE-based fatigue models to predict the degradation in MFC's performance based on the input loading
