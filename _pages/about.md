I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am being co-advised by [Dr. Sinan Keten](https://www.keten-group.northwestern.edu/) and [Dr. Wei Chen](https://ideal.mech.northwestern.edu/). 

Currently, I am working to develop an interpretable deep-learning (DL) model for proteins to estimate the importance of different positions in a sequence of amino acids. In the past, I have developed DL models to study protein’s dynamic as well as mechanical properties. 

While working on DL models for proteins, I have developed a special interest in sequence-based DL models. I really enjoy architecting and training DL models from scratch. Due to this interest, I have worked on projects/challenges involving biosignals and audio signals too. In June 2023, I and my other teammate secured the third position in one of the **ICASSP’23** challenges and presented that work in the conference. One of my other papers on emotion share prediction using large language model embeddings has been **published** in **ACM MM’23** as one of the first authors.

During June-August 2025, I worked as a Data Scientist PhD Intern at **Capital One**. During the internship, I worked on Explainable AI methods for transformer-based models to estimate feature importance as well as the importance of different time points in a sequential data. Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as a Lead and Advanced Engineer at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Rolls-Royce](https://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services/civil-aerospace.aspx) respectively. In both companies, I was responsible for the stress analysis and fatigue life assessment of Titanium and Nickel alloy-based rotating discs in Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB engines. I have a Masters by Research in Applied Mechanics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I worked on characterizing the fatigue properties of smart piezoelectric composite material using experimental as well as Finite Element Analysis techniques.
