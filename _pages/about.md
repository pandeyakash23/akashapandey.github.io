I am a second year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am being co-advised by [Dr. Sinan Keten](https://www.keten-group.northwestern.edu/) and [Dr. Wei Chen](https://ideal.mech.northwestern.edu/). 

Currently I am using Deep Learning (DL) models to study protein's dynamic as well as mechanical properties. My current research project is to  predict mechanical properties of spider silk and use DL models to lay some design rules for making superior protein based materials. 

While working on DL models for proteins, I have developed a special interest in sequence-based models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and attention. I really enjoy architecting and training DL models from scrtach. Due to this interest, I have worked on projects/challegenes involving biosignals and audio signals too. In June 2023, me and my other team mate secured third position in one of the ICASSP'23 challenge and presented that work in the conference. Recently, I have submitted a paper on emotion share prediction using large languae model embeddings in ACM MM'23 as one of the first authors.

Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as a Lead and Advanced Engineer at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Rolls-Royce](https://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services/civil-aerospace.aspx) respectively. In both companies, I was responsible for the stress analysis and fatigue life assessment of Titanium and Nickel alloy-based rotating discs in Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB engines. I have a Masters by Research in Applied Mechanics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I worked on characterizing the fatigue properties of smart piezoelectric composite material using experimental as well as Finite Element Analysis techniques.
