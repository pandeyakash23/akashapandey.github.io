I am a second year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am being co-advised by [Dr. Sinan Keten](https://www.keten-group.northwestern.edu/) and [Dr. Wei Chen](https://ideal.mech.northwestern.edu/). 

Currently I am using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to study protein's dynamic as well as mechanical properties. In the upcoming future, I plan to make interpretable models for protein which can be used to identify motifs which are driving the properties within proteins. 

While working on DL models for proteins, I have developed a special interest in sequence-based models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). I really enjoy architecting and training DL models from scrtach. Due to this interest, I have worked on projects/challegenes involving biomedical and audio signals too. 

Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as a Lead and Advanced Engineer at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Rolls-Royce](https://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services/civil-aerospace.aspx) respectively. In both companies, I was responsible for the stress analysis and fatigue life assessment of Titanium and Nickel alloy-based rotating discs in Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB engines. I have a Masters by Research in Applied Mechanics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I worked on characterizing the fatigue properties of smart piezoelectric composite material using experimental as well as Finite Element Analysis techniques.
